# Police_secure_check01
**Project overview:**

A Python data module that connects to MySQL, optionally creates/inserts a table, queries Police_traffic_details1, cleans columns, and exposes a function Traffic_details() returning a pandas DataFrame.
A Streamlit app with three pages: Home, Traffic Reports (filters a DataFrame), and Advanced Insights (runs SQL queries via mysql-connector).
The Streamlit app must be launched via the CLI to avoid missing ScriptRunContext warnings and to enable widgets/session state.

**Packages used:**
*mysql-connector-python* for DB connection and cursor operations.
*pandas* for DataFrame transforms and display.
*streamlit* for the web UI, widgets, and layout.

**Setup:**
create a virtual environment, pip install -r requirements.txt, ensure the MySQL database exists, optionally run the create/insert block from Traffic_data.py to populate Police_traffic_details1.
**Run:** streamlit run Traffic_data_Streamlit.py, with the reminder that python Traffic_data_Streamlit.py will produce ScriptRunContext warnings and limited functionality.

I have create 2 py file for this projects one for data collection and cleaning,other one for streamilt

1st file (Traffic_data) i have connect sql and python via mysqlconnect module..then create a tablre the name of Police_traffic_details1, after create, fetch the orginal data from local to df using pandas module and save as df
then insert the dataframe(df) data to sql Police_traffic_details1 table..after that check the null values(missing values)
once clean and change rows name user friendly, then save that clean data as data variable
create one user defined package as DATA_POLICE, return that cleaned data on that module

2nd file (Traffic_data_streamlit) i have import data_police module from traffic_data file then using steamlit sidebar to create navigation bar(home,traffic reports,advanced insights)
Home page: info and awareness video.
Traffic Reports: select filters from cleaned DataFrame returned by Traffic_details().
Advanced Insights: choose a predefined SQL query, click Run to execute via mysql-connector and display results in a dataframe
